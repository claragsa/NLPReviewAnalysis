# Product Review Analysis of Sephora Using NLP and Visualizations

This project aims to analyze thousands of beauty product reviews from Sephora, answering key questions about popularity, customer perception, most discussed topics, and user sentiment. Using NLP techniques and exploratory analysis, we seek insights that can support the company in marketing strategies and product development.

---

## Business Questions

- Which products have the most reviews?
- Which products and brands are the highest rated?
- What is the overall sentiment of reviews by product type?
- What are the main topics mentioned in the reviews?
- Which topics show the most positive or negative sentiments?

---

## Data

The project uses two datasets:

- `df_info`: Product information (name, brand, rating, number of reviews, etc.)
- `dfs_reviews`: A list with five DataFrames containing textual reviews and metadata (rating, recommendation, date, etc.)

### Preprocessing

- Removal of irrelevant columns (`Unnamed: 0`)
- Elimination of null values in critical columns (rating, reviews, review_text, etc.)
- Tokenization, cleaning, and normalization of text

### Topics with BERTopic

- **50 unique topics** were extracted using BERTopic to reduce redundancy.

### Most Discussed Topics

üí° Skincare-related topics dominate ‚Äî moisturizers, sunscreens, serums, etc.

### Most Positive Topics

üí° The most popular topics are also closely related to skincare. Additionally, issues like oily skin, dark circles, and chapped lips appear to be well addressed by the products.

### Most Negative Topics

üí° It is not possible to gather 10 topics where negative sentiment is predominant. Thus, the main complaints revolve around:

- Packaging that doesn't work properly  
- Changes in formulas that customers disliked  
- Products that caused a burning sensation on sensitive skin
